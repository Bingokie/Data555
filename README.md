# Maternal and Neonatal Health Dashboard

This dashboard presents interactive visualizations that explore how maternal health indicators—specifically BMI—and preterm classification relate to neonatal birth weight. The tool is designed to support both clinical understanding and data exploration in the context of maternal and child health.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard contains two interactive visualizations:

1. **Scatter Plot: Maternal BMI vs. Baby Birth Weight**  
   Reveals trends between maternal BMI and newborn weight, highlighting the potential impact of maternal health on fetal development.

2. **Bar Chart: Average Birth Weight by Preterm Group**  
   Compares birth weights across four preterm categories, emphasizing the vulnerability of more premature infants.

## 📚 Dataset Description

- **Source**: Research dataset on maternal and infant health  
- **Sample Size**: 3000+
- **Collected via**: Clinical visits and electronic health records  
- **Population**: Pregnant individuals and their newborns  

Variables used include:
- `mother_bmi`: Mother's body mass index  
- `baby_birth_weight`: Newborn's birth weight (kg)  
- `preterm_group`: Classification of prematurity  
- `Sex`: Infant sex  
- `mother_age1`: Mother's age at delivery

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

Understanding maternal health patterns—such as the relationship between BMI and birth outcomes—enables clinicians to anticipate risks and tailor prenatal care. By identifying groups of infants most at risk (e.g., extremely preterm), healthcare providers can improve neonatal outcomes and guide resource planning in clinical settings.
